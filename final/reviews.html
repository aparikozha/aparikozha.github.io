          University of Greenwich is underrated university! To begin with - I
          completed work placement. University's employability services helped
          me to find a placement, prepared me for interviews and even checked my
          cv and cover letter. On the top of that they organise multiple
          seminars and workshops to improve your employability skills which is
          essential for such a competitive job market in London. I also
          participated in student exchanges - with University of Greenwich
          support we found a perfect fit for me in Spain where I was able to
          improve my Spanish language skills! Talking about university in
          general the support from academics is always outstanding. Prior to the
          covid thing we would meet on weekly basis with our personal tutor who
          is always here to help no matter is it personal or just something to
          do with your assignments. There are so many things I could say. But
          word limit doesn't allow me. If you are considering to apply do it!
          You will thank me latter
